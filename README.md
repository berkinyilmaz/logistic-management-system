This program has been written in C++. The program aims to control, manipulate and deliver products among Warehouses. Program is a combination of WMS(Warehouse Management System) and Cargo Management System. In the transportation part, it calculates the fee and kilometer between two warehouses. On the other hand, due to the WMS, makes it easy to monitor product. 


Using this management system, you can manage your logistics company's warehouses (creating or deleting a warehouse), move the products in warehouses from one to another, calculate the fee that your customer's have to pay. You may send your products from a domestic warehouse to a abroad warehouse and vice versa.
